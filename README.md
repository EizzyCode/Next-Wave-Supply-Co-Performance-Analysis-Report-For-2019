**INTRODUCTION**

This analysis examines Next Wave Supply Co performance data to gain comprehensive insights into the company’s results for 2019. The project investigates sales patterns across their product category, identifying top-performing products and analyzing seasonal changes throughout the year. Additionally, I’ve analyzed regional sales distribution to determine regional strongholds and purchasing patterns across different markets. This technical report aims to uncover actionable insights regarding product performance, trends, and regional performance to inform strategic decision-making for future growth opportunities.

**DATA CLEANING**

The dataset was gotten from Kaggle, and several strategies were applied to ensure data consistency and accuracy:

**Duplicate Removal:** Duplicate rows were identified and deleted to prevent inconsistent results.
**Text to Columns:** Combined data points in a single column were split using the Text to Columns function, ensuring each value was properly categorized.
**Date Formatting:** Inconsistent date entries were corrected, with all dates standardized to a uniform date format for accurate time-based analysis.
**Standard Table Conversion:** The dataset was transformed into a structured Excel table to enable easier management, automation, and dynamic analysis.
These steps helped transform the raw dataset into a clean, structured foundation for insightful analysis.

Before building the charts, I conducted a pre-analysis to better understand the dataset and guide my storytelling process. This involved breaking down the data into meaningful components:

**Project Split:** I categorized the data points into dependent and independent variables, helping me understand the relationships within the dataset and what types of insights could be extracted.
**Potential Analysis & Questions:** From the grouped variables, I generated key questions that the dataset could answer. This step highlighted the potential insights hidden within the data, even before visualizing it.
**Preliminary Insights:** By thinking through the questions and data points, I uncovered early insights, which made it easier to shape the narrative and focus the analysis on valuable outcomes.
**Storytelling:** Once I had a clear understanding of the dataset, I could tell a story from it. By putting together the relationships between the datapoints and the insights uncovered.
**Industry And Stakeholders:** This process helped me identify the relevant industry, the stakeholders who would benefit from the analysis, and what success would look like for the organization based on the findings.

The chart shows that Nancy Freehafer and Anne Larsen are the top-performing salespeople, generating over $90,000 each in sales, with Nancy leading at $104,242.34. Andrew Cencini follows in third place with $67,180.50, while the rest fall into a mid-to-low performance range, with Jan Kotas trailing significantly at $16,350.50. The visual highlights a clear performance gap between the top three and the rest, suggesting a need to explore what’s driving the success of the top performers and how the lower performers can be supported.

The bar chart reveals significant customer concentration for Next Wave Supply Co in 2019, with Company D ($67,180.50) generating the highest revenue, followed by Company H ($50,198.35) and Company BB ($43,703.00). These top three customers represent a substantial portion of total revenue, while the remaining seven companies show a gradual decline in spending down to Company K ($21,937.08). This distribution suggests potential business vulnerability if top accounts were lost, highlighting the need for strategic account management.

**Sales Trend Report**

The sales trend shows fluctuations throughout the year, with noticeable peaks in June ($55,601.61), October ($53,033.59), and a significant spike in December ($66,642.78), which was the best month for sales, likely due to holiday shopping. Also, sales hit their lowest point in February ($19,955.00), making it the worst month, possibly due to a post-holiday spending dip. Despite some mid-year declines, overall sales rebounded strongly toward the end of the year.

**Sales By Region**

The sales distribution across regions shows that the North performed the best, generating $141,660.34, followed by the East with $108,275.51. The West and South had relatively lower sales, with $93,848.33 and $91,251.98, respectively. This indicates that the North is the strongest-performing region, while the South recorded the lowest sales. The significant gap suggests potential factors such as market demand, customer base, or sales strategies influencing regional performance.

The Sales by Product Category chart shows that Beverages lead with the highest sales at $110,577.11, significantly outperforming all other categories. Sauces follow in second place with $69,000, while Jams & Preserves hold the third spot at $51,541. Dairy Products and Dried Fruit & Nuts have the lowest sales, suggesting lower demand or market penetration. This indicates that Beverages dominate the market, while other categories may require improved marketing strategies or product innovation to boost sales.

**Top Ship Cities**

The Top 6 Ship Cities chart highlights New York as the leading city with $67,180.50 in sales, followed by Portland and Miami, both exceeding $50,000. Memphis, Chicago, and Milwaukee contribute lower sales, with Milwaukee at the bottom with $37,418.00. This suggests that major metropolitan areas drive higher shipping volumes, possibly due to larger customer bases and better logistics infrastructure. Businesses could explore targeted marketing in lower-performing cities to boost demand.

**Top Cites By Revenue**

The Top 5 Cities by Revenue chart shows that New York leads significantly with $67,180.50, while Portland and Miami generate similar revenue at around $50,000 each. Memphis and Chicago lag behind, with revenues under $44,000. This suggests that New York is a dominant market, possibly due to higher demand or purchasing power. Targeted marketing and expansion efforts in Memphis and Chicago could help close the revenue gap.

**OBSERVATIONS**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54fca3ad-b70a-4d61-8f7e-2f0c6c4b8109)

Analyzing city-based performance, New York stands out as the top shipping city with sales of $67,180.50, followed by Portland and Miami, which generated around $50,000 each. Meanwhile, Chicago and Memphis performed relatively lower in comparison. Similarly, in customer revenue contribution, Company D led with $67,180.50, while Company H and Company BB followed with figures above $40,000.

Looking at sales transactions by amount, most sales transactions (218) fall within the $0-$1000 range, with a steep decline in higher-value transactions. This indicates that the company relies heavily on smaller transactions, with very few exceeding $5000.

Regarding salespersons’ performance, Nancy Freehafer was the best performer, generating $104,242.34, significantly outperforming her peers. Anne Larsen and Andrew Cencini also performed well, with revenues of $93,848.33 and $67,180.50, respectively. On the other hand, Jan Kotas had the lowest revenue contribution, with $16,350.50, signaling potential improvement opportunities.

The sales trend report reveals fluctuations throughout the year. While sales remained moderate in the first half, they saw a significant jump in June ($55,601.67) and peaked in December ($66,642.78), likely influenced by seasonal demand. The lowest performing months were February and April, with revenues under $21,000, pointing to periods of slow business.

New York maintained its position as the top performing state with $6.42M in sales, followed closely by Florida and California, highlighting strong coastal market presence.

A consistent pattern shows men’s products generally outperforming their women’s equivalents across categories, suggesting opportunities for growth in the women’s segments.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6022563a-ea29-4645-8c76-be08837a894d)

Expand High-Performing Categories — Since Beverages significantly outperformed other categories, the company should consider expanding its product line within this segment or introducing complementary products. Additionally, marketing efforts should focus on promoting Sauces and Jams & Preserves, which also showed strong performance but have room for growth.

Target High-Value Transactions — Since most transactions fall under $1000, strategies to encourage larger transactions should be implemented. Offering bulk purchase discounts, loyalty programs, or exclusive high-value product bundles could incentivize bigger purchases.

Improve Underperforming Cities & Customers — While New York, Portland, and Miami performed well, Memphis and Chicago showed weaker revenues. Targeted promotions, localized marketing efforts, and stronger partnerships with businesses in these regions could improve performance. Similarly, lesser-contributing customers should be engaged with personalized deals or incentives.

Salesforce Optimization — While Nancy Freehafer and Anne Larsen are excelling, lower-performing salespeople like Jan Kotas might need additional training, mentoring, or performance-based incentives to boost their sales contributions.

Mitigate Seasonal Slumps — Since February and April showed the lowest revenue, introducing special promotions, seasonal discounts, or bundled product offers during these months could help maintain steady sales. Additionally, analyzing customer preferences during these months could reveal opportunities to introduce new sales strategies.

Leverage December’s Peak Demand — The highest sales month being December suggests an opportunity to further maximize holiday season revenue. Increasing advertising, offering festive promotions, and ensuring stock availability for high-demand products could drive even higher revenues.

**CONCLUSION**

The Next Wave Supply Co. Performance Analysis Report for 2019 highlights key trends in sales performance, regional strengths, and areas for improvement. The company’s total revenue of $436,066.16 was primarily driven by strong contributions from New York, Portland, and Miami, with Beverages emerging as the most profitable product category. Nancy Freehafer led the sales team, and Company D was the highest-paying customer. However, certain areas require attention, including underperforming regions like Memphis and Chicago, low-revenue salespeople, and a reliance on small transactions.

To maintain and accelerate growth, the company should expand high-performing product categories, encourage larger transactions, improve salesforce efficiency, and mitigate seasonal downturns. Additionally, leveraging strong customer relationships and capitalizing on peak sales months like December can drive further profitability. By focusing on these strategic improvements, Next Wave Supply Co. can optimize its sales processes, strengthen market presence, and ensure sustained revenue growth in the coming years.
